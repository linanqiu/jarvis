      <p>A panda that codes. He also likes finance, so he's a financial economics and computer science double major in Columbia College. He's from Singapore. He believes that the holy grail of engineering is for humans to be (consistently) lazy. Phrased better, that means humans doing less dumb shit. Jarvis is his attempt at doing that. He also tries to be the Head TA for this class.</p>
